<p>I've learned that some big astronomers classify Earth and Moon as dual planetary system. The tides are possible because of Moon's ability to attract the water. The interesting thing is, Moon pulls on water slowing down the Earth, and water in turn pulls on Moon making it spin faster. In a million or billion years Moon and Earth will synchronize, so the Moon will be making a full spin in 24 hours thus always being in one spot on the skies.</p>
<h2>Explain something you understand deeply as clearly as you can.</h2>
<p>I like simple designs. Take for example, a thermostat of an engine cooling system.</p>
<p>When you start the engine, you want to reach working temperature before hitting high RPM's. Thus you need coolant to not move in the cooling system. Once it's at working temperature, you want to keep temps at constant level so the thermostat opens and lets coolant run. If temperature drops, thermostat closes again.</p>
<p>I used this example to explain boolean logic to my students.</p>
<h2>What do you want to be doing in two years?</h2>
<p>More coding. More collaboration. Less repetitive work.</p>
<h2>Why do you want to do Hacker School?</h2>
<p>I love learning. I enjoy hackathons a lot, but I think they're too short and too intense. I'm kind of slow to get going but when I hit the stride, it's hard to stop me. I miss college days and I took a few courses from Stanford when all this Coursera/Udacity thing started. It was very engaging and I had a blast.</p>
<p>I love coding. I'm not very good at it, but I understand pointers and recursion and have some familiarity with a whole bunch of languages.</p>
<p>I love exploration. I get goose bumps when a few cognitive zones in my brain finally connected and a bigger pattern emerges.</p>
